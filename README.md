Asthma medical chatbot
Specialized Precision. General Brilliance. The AI chatbot that knows Asthma inside out—and everything else too.

What is this?
Asthma medical chatbot is a hybrid medical chatbot designed to bridge the gap between specialized local data and general medical intelligence.
While it is powered by a General AI specifically tuned for comprehensive medical advice on any disease, it features a supercharged local memory (SQLite) dedicated specifically to Asthma care.

Key Features:
Laser-Focused Asthma Engine: Connects to a custom SQLite database deeply populated with asthma protocols, medication guides, and management plans for instant, offline-ready precision.
Universal Medical Knowledge: Asked about Diabetes? Malaria? Hypertension? No problem. The system seamlessly switches context to provide comprehensive answers for any other medical condition.

Hybrid Architecture: Combines the reliability of structured SQL data with the flexibility of Large Language Models.
